            <h2>Hamburger Bahnhof - Museum für Gegenwart - Berlin</h2>
            <h4>Address: Invalidenstraße 50-51, 10557 Berlin</h4>
            <a href="https://www.smb.museum/en/museums-institutions/hamburger-bahnhof/home/">Website</a>
            <p>Hamburger Bahnhof serves as a contemporary art museum, the Museum für Gegenwart, part of the Berlin National Gallery.</p>
            <p>
                In the mid-1980s the Berlin entrepreneur Erich Marx offered his private collection of contemporary art to the city. The Berlin Senate decided in 1987 to establish a museum of contemporary art in the former railway station. The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation agreed to operate the museum as part of the National Gallery. A competition for the renovation of the station was announced by the Senate in 1989, and was won by the architect Josef Paul Kleihues. Between 1990 and 1996, Kleihues refurbished the building, and in November 1996 the 108,000 sq ft museum was opened with an exhibition of works by Sigmar Polke. The Museum für Gegenwart exhibits modern and contemporary art. Permanent loans from the Marx collection, including works by artists such as Joseph Beuys, Anselm Kiefer, Robert Rauschenberg, Cy Twombly and Andy Warhol, are on permanent display. An emphasis of the Nationalgalerie collection is art on video and film, including a collection of 1970s video art—a gift of Mike Steiner—and the Joseph Beuys media archives.

            <h2>Classic Remise</h2>
            <h4>Address:  Wiebestr. 36 - 37, 10553 Berlin </h4>
            <a href="https://remise.de/berlin/short-facts/englisch">Website</a>
            <p>
                This center for vintage cars was opened in 2003 in a historic tram depot, which was originally built in imperial times. Some architectural changes to the building were made in the 1920s. There were limited damages in the war, the places where firebombs damaged the building can still be seen on the ceiling. After the tram system was given up in then West-Berlin in the 1960s the depot did not serve any purpose and was in decay until the present owners bought it in 2002 and started to reconstruct it into a classic car center.
                Now there are garages, services and dealers for classic cars, shops for spare parts, clothing, model cars, accessories and restaurants in this landmark building.

            <h2>Kleiner Tiergarten (Small Tiergarten)</h2>
            <p>The park is bounded to the north by Turmstraße, Alt-Moabit to the south, Ottostraße to the west, and Wilsnacker Straße to the east. Stromstraße and Thusnelda-Allee pass through the park from north to south, as does line U9 of the Berlin U-Bahn; the subway station Turmstraße is also located adjacent from the park.</p>
            <p>
                This park's history goes back to 1655, when it was referred to as the Kleiner Tiergarten for the first time. In the year 1790, the park was replanted; further redesign took place in 1835 in connection with the newly built St. John's Church, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. After the city of Berlin took over the administration of the area in 1876, landscape architect and horticultural director Johann Heinrich Gustav Meyer redesigned the park to contain benches, lanterns, and a spring. The Heilandskirche was constructed from 1892-1894, designed by Friedrich Schulze facing Thusnelda-Allee.
            </p>
            <p>There are numerous cafes shops and resteraunt surrounding the park and many people hanging out. Don't miss the small beer garden <a href="http://www.biergarten-moabiter-freiheit.de/">Biergarten Moabiter Freiheit</a> which serves cold, famous German beer (try Berliner Pilsner or Hefeweizen) and shows big soccer games on its summer patio!</p>
