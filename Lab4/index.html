                Moabit is an inner city located in the borough of Mitte, Berlin, Germany. First inhabited in 1685 and incorporated into Berlin in 1861, the former industrial and working-class neighbourhood is fully surrounded by three watercourses -all branches of Spree- which define its present-day border. Between 1945 and 1990, Moabit was part of the British sector of West Berlin that directly bordered East Berlin.

                Colloquially, the name Moabit also refers to the Central Criminal Court (Strafgericht) and detention centre, which deals with all criminal cases in Berlin and is based in Moabit.

            <h2>History of Berlin</h2>
            <p>Moabit was part of the British sector of West Berlin after the World War II, between 1945 and 1990. Due to its new peripheral location adjacent to the Berlin Wall, Moabit became a remote neighbourhood. Similar to Kreuzberg, it attracted mostly immigrants due to its low rents. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, Moabit's location has changed to its former centrality. Post-reunification, Moabit has faced problems such as drug trafficking, poverty (most notably in its Western parts), and crime. Similar to neighbouring Wedding, lower rents have recently attracted artists and young people who brought new ideas, "cool" establishments, and blooming creativity to Moabit.</p>

            <h2>Population of Berlin</h2>
            <p>Around 81,000 people live in Moabit. According to the 2019 census, 47.8% of the population is female. 73.1% of the people are between 18 and 64 years with 12.4% above 65. Moabit is very diverse with 32.1% of the population holding a non-German nationality.</p>
