        <p>
            In Spring 2021, I took the course IT1150 Web Programming from Tri-C with the aim to gain a foundational understanding of web programming. During the course, I designed very interesting and fun websites
            each of which taught very useful concepts in HTML/CSS/Javascript that I will be using in my web programming projects in the future. Learning web programming will certainly be a life-long journey but I have the feeling that
            I had made a good start. I truly loved this course and enjoyed the material I learned. Here is a list of the websites I produced during this course:

        <div id="div1" class="hidden">
            <p>
                This project was the starting point of the course. For the first time, I produced a website that is accessible via internet using a plain text file and an image I found from the internet to describe my interest in neuro-rehabilitation.
                Looking back, I realize how awful it looked and how much I have learned since then!

        <button id="button2" class="button">Project 2: Online Shoppe</button>
        <div id="div2" class="hidden">
            <p>In this project, I designed an online sneaker shop. I had three sneaker models with pictures, features, and a comparison table for their features and prices. I also had a order page. This was the first time I learned making websites with multiple pages with references to each other. I also used CSS for the first time to integrate design elements to my website such as colors, font styles, etc. It was a very fun project.</p>

        <button id="button3" class="button">Project 3: The Face Maker</button>
        <div id="div3" class="hidden">
            <p>In this project, I made a Potato Man with customizable face features, which are grouped in categories. For example, there is a category "Eyes" from which the user can choose a pair of eyes for the Potato Man. Whenever the user makes a choice, we hear the Potato Man giggling at us. In my opinion, this was the most creative and entertaining project of the course.</p>

        <button id="button4" class="button">Project 4: The City Project</button>
        <div id="div4" class="hidden">
            <p>In this project, I designed a tourism information website for a district called Moabit in Berlin. My website used Responsive Design techniques (for the first time!) so the pages looked good on both a computer browser and a cell phone screen. This was the most time-consuming project of the course (therefore we had double credit) but the end result was very rewarding. I was happy to receive great feedback from our instructor, Prof. Ostroske.</p>

        <button id="button5" class="button">Project 5: Internet Organizations</button>
        <div id="div5" class="hidden">
            <p>In this project, I designed a website to describe three important internet organizations: The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The aim was to understand their functions and explain a specific mission they are involved in. This was the project I learned how to use JQuery.</p>
