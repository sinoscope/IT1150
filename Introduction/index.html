<h1>Sinem B.B</h1>
<h2>Aims with IT1150</h2>
<p>With IT1150, I hope to gain a foundational understanding for web programming. I hope to design websites in my personal and professional life (hopefully better than this one!) and build on the skills I will develop in this class. </p>
<h2>Why computers and programming?</h2>
<p>I am interested in computers and programming because I am in a field (healthcare and science) where technology plays a big role. In recent years, particularly after the COVID-19 outbreak, the need for mobile technologies is increasing everywhere as well as in my profession. Also, like learning other languages, I find learning computer languages very enjoyable.</p>
<h2>Goals after graduating from Tri-C</h2>
<p>I hope to continue my education in the field of physical therapy and rehabilitation.</p>
